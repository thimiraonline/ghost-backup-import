If you've ever used an email client with a concept of saved replies then this will be immediately intuitive.\n\nTo create a snippet, select a piece of content in the editor that you'd like to re-use in future, then click on the snippet icon in the toolbar. Give your snippet a name, and you're all done. Now your snippet will be available from within the card menu, or you can search for it directly using the / command.\n\nThis works really well for saving images you might want to use often, like a company logo or team photo, links to resources you find yourself often linking to, or introductions and passages that you want to remember.\n\nYou can even build entire post templates or outlines to create a quick, re-usable workflow for publishing over time. Or build custom design elements for your post with an HTML card, and use a snippet to insert it.\n\nOnce you get a few useful snippets set up, it's difficult to go back to the old way of diving through media libraries and trawling for that one thing you know you used somewhere that one time.\n\n\nPublishing and newsletters the easy way\n\nWhen you're ready to publish, Ghost makes it as simple as possible to deliver your new post to all your existing members. Just hit the Preview link and you'll get a chance to see what your content looks like on Web, Mobile, Email and Social.\n\nYou can send yourself a test newsletter to make sure everything looks good in your email client, and then hit the Publish button to decide who to deliver it to.\n\nGhost comes with a streamlined, optimized email newsletter template that has settings built-in for you to customize the colors and typography. We've spent countless hours refining the template to make sure it works great across all email clients, and performs well for email deliverability.\n\nSo, you don't need to fight the awful process of building a custom email template from scratch. It's all done already!\n\nThe Ghost editor is powerful enough to do whatever you want it to do. With a little exploration, you'll be up and running in no time.","feature_image":"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/writing-posts-with-ghost.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-04-09 23:52:08","updated_at":"2021-04-11 07:18:53","published_at":"2021-04-10 03:52:00","custom_excerpt":"A full overview of all the features built into the Ghost editor, including powerful workflow automations to speed up your creative process.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"64218beee2376d5d42133f01","uuid":"fe80ff3c-1115-4582-87ba-86d664563101","title":"Customizing your brand and design settings","slug":"design","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/brandsettings.png\",\"width\":3456,\"height\":2338,\"cardWidth\":\"wide\",\"caption\":\"Ghost Admin → Settings → Branding\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/themesettings.png\",\"width\":3208,\"height\":1618,\"cardWidth\":\"wide\",\"caption\":\"Ghost Admin → Settings → Theme\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"{{#post}}\\n<article class=\\\"article {{post_class}}\\\">\\n\\n    <h1>{{title}}</h1>\\n    \\n    {{#if feature_image}}\\n    \\t<img src=\\\"{{feature_image}}\\\" alt=\\\"Feature image\\\" />\\n    {{/if}}\\n    \\n    {{content}}\\n\\n</article>\\n{{/post}}\",\"language\":\"handlebars\",\"caption\":\"A snippet from a post template\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"__GHOST_URL__/welcome/\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org/themes/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://github.com/tryghost/casper/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org/docs/themes/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"As discussed in the \"],[0,[0],1,\"introduction\"],[0,[],0,\" post, one of the best tings about Ghost is just how much you can customize to turn your site into something unique.

The majority of people use one of Ghost's built-in themes to get started, and then progress to something more bespoke later on as their site grows.\n\nThe best way to get started is with Ghost's branding settings, where you can set up colors, images and logos to fit with your brand.\n\nAny Ghost theme that's up to date and compatible with Ghost 4.0 and higher will reflect your branding settings in the preview window, so you can see what your site will look like as you experiment with different options.\n\nWhen selecting an accent color, try to choose something which will contrast well with white text. Many themes will use your accent color as the background for buttons, headers and navigational elements. Vibrant colors with a darker hue tend to work best, as a general rule.\n\nHowever, there are hundreds of different themes available to install, so you can pick out a look and feel that suits you best.\n\nInside Ghost's theme settings you'll find 4 more official themes that can be directly installed and activated. Each theme is suited to slightly different use-cases.\n\n * Casper (default) — Made for all sorts of blogs and newsletters\n * Edition — A beautiful minimal template for newsletter authors\n * Alto — A slick news/magazine style design for creators\n * London — A light photography theme with a bold grid\n * Ease — A library theme for organizing large content archives\n\nAnd if none of those feel quite right, head on over to the Ghost Marketplace, where you'll find a huge variety of both free and premium themes.\n\n\nBuilding something custom\n\nFinally, if you want something completely bespoke for your site, you can always build a custom theme from scratch and upload it to your site.\n\nGhost's theming template files are very easy to work with, and can be picked up in the space of a few hours by anyone who has just a little bit of knowledge of HTML and CSS. Templates from other platforms can also be ported to Ghost with relatively little effort.\n\nIf you want to take a quick look at the theme syntax to see what it's like, you can browse through the files of the default Casper theme. We've added tons of inline code comments to make it easy to learn, and the structure is very readable.\n\nSee? Not that scary! But still completely optional.\n\nIf you're interested in creating your own Ghost theme, check out our extensive theme documentation for a full guide to all the different template variables and helpers which are available.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1513185158878-8d8c2a2a3da3?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI2fHxidXJnZXJ8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjI3MTgxNTM2&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2021-07-01 02:43:08","updated_at":"2021-07-25 02:52:30","published_at":"2021-07-01 02:53:13","custom_excerpt":"f you can limit your pizza to just two slices out of eight large pan, the calorie count plus the grated cheese topping is 480 calories.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"64218beee2376d5d42133f43","uuid":"43987d2b-37b1-4fa4-a520-11014579b617","title":"The Best Homemade Pizza You'll Ever Eat","slug":"the-best-homemade-pizza-youll-ever-eat","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"paywall\",{}],[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<div class=\\\"row\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"col-md-6\\\">\\n        <ul>\\n            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>\\n            <li>Cornmeal (to help slide the pizza onto the pizza stone)</li>\\n            <li>Tomato sauce (smooth or pureed)</li>\\n            <li>Firm mozzarella cheese, grated</li>\\n            <li>Fresh soft mozzarella cheese, separated into small clumps</li>\\n            <li>Fontina cheese, grated</li>\\n            <li>Parmesan cheese, grated</li>\\n            <li>Feta cheese, crumbled</li>\\n            <li>Mushrooms, very thinly sliced if raw, otherwise first sautéed</li>\\n            <li>Bell peppers, stems and seeds removed, very thinly sliced</li>\\n        </ul>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\\\"col-md-6\\\">\\n        <ul>\\n            <li>Italian pepperoncini, thinly sliced</li>\\n            <li>Italian sausage, cooked ahead and crumbled</li>\\n            <li>Sliced black olives</li>\\n            <li>Chopped fresh basil</li>\\n            <li>Baby arugula, tossed in a little olive oil, added as pizza comes out of the oven</li>\\n            <li>Pesto</li>\\n            <li>Pepperoni, thinly sliced</li>\\n            <li>Onions, thinly sliced raw or caramelized</li>\\n            <li>Ham, thinly sliced</li>\\n        </ul>\\n    </div>\\n</div>\\n\"}],[\"embed\",{\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX1JucyW8G4\",\"html\":\"<iframe width=\\\"200\\\" height=\\\"113\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PX1JucyW8G4?feature=oembed\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\",\"type\":\"video\",\"metadata\":{\"title\":\"Dominos Style Paneer Makhani Pizza Recipe - Secret Method - CookingShooking\",\"author_name\":\"CookingShooking\",\"author_url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/c/CookingshookingIn\",\"height\":113,\"width\":200,\"version\":\"1.0\",\"provider_name\":\"YouTube\",\"provider_url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/\",\"thumbnail_height\":360,\"thumbnail_width\":480,\"thumbnail_url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PX1JucyW8G4/hqdefault.jpg\"}}]],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Pizza calories are higher than expected.\"]]],[1,\"h3\",[[0,[],0,\"Ingredients\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0,0],2,\"Pizza Dough: Makes enough dough for two 10-12 inch pizzas\"]]],[3,\"ul\",[[[0,[],0,\"1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)\"]],[[0,[],0,\"1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast\"]],[[0,[],0,\"3 3/4 cups (490 g) bread flour\"]],[[0,[],0,\"2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)\"]],[[0,[],0,\"2 teaspoons salt\"]],[[0,[],0,\"1 teaspoon sugar\"]]]],[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0,0],2,\"Pizza Ingredients and Topping Options\"]]],[10,1],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Friends, today I am sharing Dominos Style Paneer Makhani Pizza Recipe..

Please be aware that some countries may not allow airmail shipments of large-sized items, so Courier is also recommended when ordering banners, banner stands, and meeting signs.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1513004132127-ade5a645d3e0?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fGFpcm1haWx8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjUzNTQzMjAx&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2021-07-01 16:56:31","updated_at":"2023-03-27 12:58:54","published_at":"2021-07-01 16:56:47","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"64218beee2376d5d42133f59","uuid":"db430532-4820-487c-ab2d-4cb7afb3f1eb","title":"Fashion trends and their impact on the society","slug":"fashion-trends-and-their-impact-on-the-society","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"gallery\",{\"images\":[{\"fileName\":\"author-img.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":400,\"height\":435,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/07/author-img.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"author-img2.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":400,\"height\":435,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/07/author-img2.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"author-img3.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":400,\"height\":435,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/07/author-img3.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"author-img4.jpg\",\"row\":1,\"width\":400,\"height\":435,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/07/author-img4.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"author-img5.jpg\",\"row\":1,\"width\":400,\"height\":435,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/07/author-img5.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"author-img6.jpg\",\"row\":1,\"width\":400,\"height\":435,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/07/author-img6.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"author-img7.jpg\",\"row\":2,\"width\":400,\"height\":435,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/07/author-img7-1.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"author-img8.jpg\",\"row\":2,\"width\":400,\"height\":435,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/07/author-img8.jpg\"}]}],[\"embed\",{\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jGSNFt-6Ic\",\"html\":\"<iframe width=\\\"200\\\" height=\\\"113\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-jGSNFt-6Ic?feature=oembed\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\",\"type\":\"video\",\"metadata\":{\"title\":\"10 Easy Ways to Style Jeans with T-Shirts | Men’s Fashion | Casual Outfit Ideas\",\"author_name\":\"One Dapper Street\",\"author_url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/c/onedapperstreet\",\"height\":113,\"width\":200,\"version\":\"1.0\",\"provider_name\":\"YouTube\",\"provider_url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/\",\"thumbnail_height\":360,\"thumbnail_width\":480,\"thumbnail_url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-jGSNFt-6Ic/hqdefault.jpg\"}}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"strong\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Take a closer look at the negative impact of the fast \"],[0,[0],1,\"fashion\"],[0,[],0,\" industry in our environment.
